Throughout the years I have been spending my professional life on the Visual Effects industry. I had produced 3D animation and digital visual effects for TV series and films. It was a time with fun and challenging. I now work for a software development company, as a designer and technical director for art department. I'm going to get into a new field and do more research in 3D animation pipeline.
